The business process illustrated here represents a call center operation handling insurance claims, specifically focusing on two locations: Brisbane and Sydney. In Brisbane, the call center operates 24/7, while in Sydney, it follows a standard working week of 9 to 5. Both centers share a common workflow beginning with a phone call received, after which the call is directed to a call center agent. This initial step takes about 30 seconds. The agent is tasked with verifying whether sufficient information is present to proceed, which results in a branching path: either the information is sufficient, leading directly to claim registration, or more information is needed, looping back to the agent for additional gathering.

Once a claim is registered, the next phase involves assessing the likelihood of a claim, handled by a claims handler. This step determines if the insured party could be liable, with the probability of 0.15 that liability isn’t possible, and 0.85 that it could be. Claims assessed as likely proceed to a detailed evaluation, taking a significant share of time in the process—660 seconds for assessment. After a claim is assessed, there’s an 80% chance it will be accepted, and in this case, the handler initiates payment, taking about 120 seconds. Conversely, if a claim is rejected, the handler advises the claimant regarding reimbursement in a step taking 180 seconds.

The entire process concludes with closing the claim, a final step managed by the claims handler, wrapping up the workflow in 30 seconds. As a whole, this sequence reflects a robust operation, though optimizations could enhance efficiency and user experience. 

Streamlining the intake process by harnessing advanced information collection tools or automating parts of the initial claim registration could reduce bottlenecks and lessen agent load. Implementing AI-driven tools to assist claims handlers in assessing likelihood could further quicken this stage, increasing throughput and reducing error margins. Aligning operational hours more closely with peak activity periods, especially in Sydney, could also prove beneficial, potentially extending beyond the current framework to match modern flexible service expectations.

Ultimately, in comparison to industry best practices, there is room for integrating technology solutions that automate routine steps, enhance data accuracy, and expedite decision-making processes, thereby improving efficiency and service satisfaction overall.
