The business process begins with the Buyer Process, where a request for a quote is sent to the global collaboration process. This request is then forwarded to the Seller Process, which marks the start of the seller's involvement. Once the seller receives the request, they check their product catalog and obtain stock information to determine the possibility of fulfilling the order. If the product can be produced, the next step is to calculate the product price. This information, along with any possible rejection, is sent back through the collaboration process to the buyer.

After receiving the quote, the buyer evaluates the information and either approves financially or declines. Upon financial approval, the buyer proceeds to send a purchase order back through the process to the seller. The seller then assesses the purchase order and checks the customerâ€™s credibility. Based on this evaluation, an order acceptance or rejection is communicated back to the buyer through the collaboration process, concluding the transaction.

In terms of optimization, this process can benefit from automating repetitive tasks, such as checking stock levels and customer credibility, which reduces manual errors and speeds up the process. Implementing a digital product catalog that updates in real-time could streamline the catalog checking phase. Additionally, using analytics to predict stock needs more accurately could prevent issues of product unavailability. 

Comparing this process to best practices, transparency and speed are critical. Ensuring all parties have access to status updates can improve collaboration. Furthermore, integrating a centralized platform for communication and tracking can lead to a more seamless transaction flow, minimizing delays and enhancing overall efficiency. This way, the process becomes more agile and adaptable to changing business environments.
