The business process outlined in the diagram revolves around the management of proximal femoral fractures from prehospital admission to poststationary treatment. Initially, patients are admitted where they undergo anamnesis and clinical examination. This step is crucial for determining whether there is a clinical suspicion of a proximal femoral fracture. If no suspicion exists, the process directs the patient to receive therapy based on other diagnoses or symptoms. However, if there is a suspicion, the patient is sent for imaging diagnostics to confirm the presence of a fracture and to evaluate the need for surgical intervention.

Upon confirming a proximal femoral fracture and determining the necessity for surgery, the patient is moved to the initial treatment phase. This is where operation planning takes place, typically in a dedicated emergency area. This stage is vital for preparing the patient adequately for surgery and ensuring all necessary resources are allocated efficiently. Following the operation, the patient is transferred to the ward or ICU, depending on their needs for closer monitoring and post-operative care.

In the poststationary phase, further evaluation is conducted to clarify any underlying osteoporosis through dedicated assessments. This is a critical juncture to prevent future fractures and ensure comprehensive patient recovery and management. Finally, the process concludes with discharge and documentation, which involves recording the treatment outcomes and providing necessary follow-up care instructions.

To enhance this process, seamless integration and adoption of IT systems can be beneficial across all stages. For instance, implementing electronic health records can streamline information flow and support decision-making, particularly during anamnesis and clinical examinations. Comparing this model to best practices, ensuring multidisciplinary collaboration and prompt communication between departments can significantly enhance patient outcomes. Moreover, leveraging predictive analytics and machine learning could improve predictive accuracy in identifying fracture risks, thereby optimizing the treatment planning and resource allocation from the outset.
