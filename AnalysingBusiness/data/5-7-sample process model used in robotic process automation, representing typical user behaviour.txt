The depicted business process outlines a series of steps for handling invoices received via email. It begins when an email with an attached invoice is received. The first action is to open the email message and then proceed to save the attached invoice locally. Following this, the invoice is opened in a PDF viewer to allow for easy reference. Further, a spreadsheet is opened alongside the invoice so that the necessary data can be transferred.

The process involves iterating over all fields in the invoice. For each field, data is copied from the invoice and pasted into the appropriate column in the spreadsheet. This loop continues until all required fields are transferred. Once all the data is accurately populated in the spreadsheet, the final step is saving the spreadsheet, marking the invoice as processed.

This workflow can be quite manual and time-consuming, as it requires human intervention for every invoice. To optimize, consider using optical character recognition (OCR) technology to automate the data extraction from the PDF invoices. Implementing an automated data integration tool could further streamline the process by directly importing the data into the spreadsheet without manual copying and pasting. These changes not only save time but also reduce the likelihood of human error.

Compared to good practices in invoice processing, automation is key. Many organizations use end-to-end automated invoicing solutions that can read invoices from emails and automatically extract, validate, and store the data in a central system. Implementing such solutions can lead to significant efficiency gains, improved accuracy, and faster invoice processing times, aligning the company with industry best practices.
