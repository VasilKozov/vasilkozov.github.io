The business process begins with the initiation of batch production, followed by the handling phase where new boxes are positioned in preparation for the assemblies being processed. Once the box is placed, the process moves to placing a carton sheet in the box when a layer in the box is full, ensuring proper packaging structure. Assemblies arriving from the conveyor belt are then unloaded by the handling team.

Next, the process moves to the product quality inspection phase. During this phase, a visual inspection is conducted to ensure each assembly conforms to the specified criteria. If no defects are detected, assemblies proceed to be placed in the packaging. In the case of defect detection, a deeper evaluation occurs to determine the nature and seriousness of the defect within allocated time constraints. False negatives are recorded, and defects that can be corrected proceed to be addressed. Assemblies with unresolvable issues are placed on a reject platform.

Handling defective assemblies involves notifying the relevant parties, ensuring the management is aware of production interruptions if the reject platform reaches capacity. Alternatively, assemblies without defects are handled by the multiple packaging department, where efficient packaging methods are applied to maximize space. Once optimal packaging is verified with space availability checked, the assembly is officially packaged, and the process completes with a packaging completion notification.

Optimizing this process involves enhancing the defect detection mechanism using more automated and precise technology, reducing manual oversight and potential errors. Introducing machine learning-based inspections could foresee defect patterns, thereby preempting future errors. Additionally, adopting lean management principles could minimize overproduction and waste, streamlining the entire workflow towards just-in-time production, thus aligning with industry best practices.
