The business process of the company is structured into three primary categories: Management, Core, and Support Processes. At the top, the Management Processes involve defining, operationalizing, and tracking the company's strategy, as well as managing sales, franchises, and partners. This level of processes establishes the strategic direction of the company, ensuring that the vision and objectives are effectively translated into actionable plans. By managing sales and partnerships strategically, the company can expand its market reach and optimize revenue opportunities.

Moving to the Core Processes, we see the fundamental activities that drive the company's value creation. These processes include Innovate, Sell, and Deliver. Innovation is the starting point, suggesting that the company emphasizes creating new products or services or improving existing ones to meet market demands. Selling follows, representing the activities involved in bringing these innovations to market. Finally, delivery ensures that the product or service reaches the customer in a timely and efficient manner, completing the value chain from idea to customer satisfaction. This streamlined process is essential for maintaining competitiveness and customer satisfaction.

Support Processes provide the necessary infrastructure to ensure the company operates smoothly and efficiently. They encompass attracting, developing, and retaining the workforce, which underscores the importance of maintaining a strong human resource base. Workplace and infrastructure provision indicates the need for a supportive work environment and the necessary tools to facilitate operations. Procure to Pay involves managing the procurement process efficiently, which includes purchasing supplies and managing vendor relationships. Corporate Finance and Operational Compliance ensure that the company adheres to financial regulations and operational standards, while Shareholder and Stakeholder Management highlights the importance of maintaining transparent and effective communication with key stakeholders.

For optimization, focusing on integrating technological advancements, such as AI and automation, into both the support and core processes could streamline operations, enhance productivity, and reduce costs. Comparing this to best practices, companies leading in this field often leverage data analytics for strategy tracking and partner management to refine their decision-making processes. They also tend to foster an innovation-driven culture, supported by agile methodologies, to accelerate product development and delivery. Overall, aligning these processes with digital transformation initiatives and emphasizing continuous improvement could further enhance the company's efficiency and competitiveness.
