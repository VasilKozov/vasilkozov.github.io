The business process depicted in the flowchart outlines the operations of a call center system split between two locations, Brisbane operating 24/7 and Sydney running five days a week. In both centers, the process begins with a phone call, where an initial check is performed to ensure sufficient information is available. Depending on the adequacy of the information, the claim is either logged immediately by an expert agent or passed on to a novice agent if further information gathering is needed. It’s notable that in Brisbane, calls are primarily handled 24/7, potentially increasing accessibility for clients, whereas Sydney handles calls during standard business hours, perhaps catering to more localized operations and workforce capabilities.

Once a claim is registered, the flow then converges at a decision point where the likelihood of the insured being liable is determined. After this assessment, if the insured is deemed liable, the system verifies the total processing time of the claim. This entire segment appears to be time-sensitive, optimized to deliver quick assessments—evidenced by the duration metrics provided at each decision juncture. The claims handler plays a crucial role, assessing claims either by an expedited or a more detailed method, consequently affecting the acceptance or rejection of claims.

The final stages of the process focus on claims resolution, where accepted claims lead to either the initiation of payment or advisement for reimbursement to the claimant. Each action complements the overall goal of expedient and thorough claim handling. Rejected claims are immediately closed, ensuring resources are allocated effectively.

For optimization, improvements could be implemented by integrating more advanced triage algorithms or AI-driven information verification, potentially reducing the input time by human agents. Furthermore, incorporating a real-time analytics system could enhance the decision-making process, allowing for a dynamic adaptation of workflow priorities based on incoming call volume or claim urgency. Compared to industry best practices, minimizing manual data checks and increasing automation could accelerate the claim registration phase, where real-time data validation could be crucial. Moreover, aligning the working hours of Sydney to cover extended time frames, or implementing rotational shifts, could spread operational load and mitigate peak-time pressure, thereby improving overall customer service and satisfaction. Enhanced training programs for novice agents might also streamline the duration of calls, transitioning more cases immediately to experts, aligning more closely with customer expectations for swift resolution.
